## Notes
- domain layer -> responsible with providing the raw data either from remote either from local
- data layer -> responsible with business logic; group all data which is required by the consumer
and map it to a ready-to-consume state 
- ui layer -> responsible with consuming the data and rendering it to the UI; react to user input;
